# 

This is an ecological analysis of 20,000 high schools in the United States to understand whether high rates of chronic absenteeism predict low graduation rates.

# Data

This data comes from ....

<https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/index.html#acgr>
<https://ocrdata.ed.gov/DataFileUsersManual>


# Measures

- Graduation rate (Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate)

  - Number of graduating students divided by
  - The number of students who started 9th grade net of in/out migration
  - Percentage of students that graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma
  - https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=805
 

- Chronic Absenteeism rate
  - Students that miss 15 days or more in a school year
  - All absences of more than 50% of the day count, sickness, vacation, court appearance, susupension, etc.
  - https://ocrdata.ed.gov/Downloads/Master-List-of-CRDC-Definitions.pdf

- Covariates

  - Structural conditions (teacher certification, teacher absenteeism)
  - administrative care (civil rights, sexual assault, violations, disciplinary actions)
  - student engagement/achievement (sports participation, enrollment in higher math, AP)

# Question

Will reducing absenteeism improve high school graduation rates? And if so, can the analysis suggest any approaches to reducing absenteeism?

# Data

```{r eda_plots, echo = F, include = F}

require(hexbin)
hbin = hexbin(a_frame$abs_r, a_frame$grad_r, xbins = 20, xlab = "Absenteeism Rate", ylab = "Graduation Rate")
plot(hbin)
# with(a_frame, lines(abs_r ~ grad_r))
# abline(lm(grad_r ~ abs_r, data = a_frame))
```

```{r}
cor(a_frame) %>% round(2)
:w
```

# Relationship between absenteeism and graduation

# Causal model
